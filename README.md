First and foremost, Welcome! ðŸŽ‰ Willkommen! ðŸŽŠ Bienvenue! ðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆ

Hi! My name is Di. My desire is to unearth data overlooked and misrepresented in society grew from finding a way to speak up for myself and my communities. Since 2015 I was selected as a Making All Voices Count Bronze Prize recipient and a Mozilla Open Source Leader. DemoChat, an app for garment factory workers to report labor and workplace violations, is an initiative fused from my professional experience in labor rights, technology, and social entrepreneurship.
